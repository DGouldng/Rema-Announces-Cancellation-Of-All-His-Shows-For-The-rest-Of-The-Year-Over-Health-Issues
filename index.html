        <p class="para">
          Years of touring have really taken a toll on Rema, the Nigerian singer. He recently announced that he's cancelling all performances in December to prioritize his health.
        </p>

        <p class="para">
          The Afrobeats star announced the decision on Wednesday on Instagram, saying it “breaks my heart”.
          <br>
          "I need time to recuperate," he told fans, promising "2024 we go again".
        </p>

        <p class="para">
          Rema is absolutely killing it internationally with his hit song "Calm Down"! It's been breaking streaming and chart records left and right. He's definitely making waves in the music scene. So awesome to see his talent being recognized worldwide! 
        </p>

        
        <p class="para">
          It's heartbreaking to hear that the Afrobeats star had to make the difficult decision to cancel his performances. It must have been a tough choice for him. I hope he takes this time to focus on his health and well-being. Let's send him all our love and support during this time.
        </p>

        <p class="para">
          Rema, whose real name is Divine Ikubor, had an epic performance at London's massive O2 arena, He made a grand entrance by riding in on a carousel pony.
        </p>

        <p class="para">
          During his performance, Rema took the opportunity to shed light on the Benin Bronzes. These incredible artifacts hold immense cultural value and were unfortunately looted by British colonialists in the 19th century. 
        </p>

        <p class="para">
          It's important to remember and acknowledge their significance, especially since many of them are still housed in the British Museum today. Rema is using his platform to raise awareness about this important issue.
        </p>


        <p class="para">
          The singer really knows how to push the boundaries with her fashion choices. Remember at the British Fashion Awards, she transformed herself into part human, part reptile with those bizarre dinosaur-like silver spikes down her back. It's amazing how she can bring such unique and creative concepts to life on the red carpet. Fashion truly is a form of art! 
        </p>

        <p class="para">
          “My ancestors' bronzes sit in the museum of this very city so I remade mine,” Rema said on social media, explaining the visuals in his London show.
        </p>

        <p class="para">
          It's such a bummer that Rema had to cancel his December tour dates in Abuja, Benin, and Lagos. I can only imagine how disappointed his fans must be. Hopefully, he'll be able to reschedule those shows in the future. Until then, let's keep supporting him and enjoying his amazing music!
